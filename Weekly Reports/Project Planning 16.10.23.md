## Adaptive Navigation of Land Robots in Tight Spaces and Dynamic Environments using RL Weekly Report 16.10.2023 / Project Planning

### Project Summary:
In our control & automation bachelor's design project, we aim to simulate a robot, using Gazebo, that can navigate tight and dynamically-obstructed warehouses or production lines. Combining the capabilities of ROS 2 tools like Nav2 and Cartographer with Reinforcement Learning, the robot will adaptively navigate between waypoints, especially in scenarios where traditional algorithms might be challenged. The robot's operations and decisions will be visualized in real-time using Rviz, offering an innovative approach to advanced robotics in complex environments.
